This project is an attempt to make a open source Lean Poker server that is compatible with the "official" Lean Poker server implementation (http://leanpoker.org/)

This need appeared after I attended Lean Poker event on a conference, and after coming back home, I wanted to try out new ideas, but the official tournament has ended and the server wasn't available for me to try them out.
